/**
 * @brief Illustrates how to wait for the completion of child tasks.
 * @details This application consists of a thread, in an OpenMP parallel region,
 * that spawns tasks. It first spawns two tasks, then wait for these to complete
 * before spawning a third task. The execution flow can be visualised below:
 *
 * single construct
 *   |
 *   +------------------------------------------> spawns task 1 --------+
 *   |                                                                  |
 *   |                                                            +-----+-----+
 *   +------------------------------------------> spawns task 2   | A thread  |
 *   |                                                  |         | will pick |
 *   |                                            +-----+-----+   | it up and |
 *   |                                            | A thread  |   | execute   |
 *   |                                            | will pick |   | this task |
 *   |                                            | it up and |   +-----+-----+
 *   |                                            | execute   |         |
 *   |                                            | this task |         |
